two ways:
1. change in fs and then git it
2. use git to both change and add it to staging area


method 1: 
if you rename a file say "aaa.txt" to "bbb.txt"
then git sees it as a deletion first and then creation of a new file
so you'll have to two gits
i.e         $ git add "bbb.txt"
            $ git rm "aaa.txt"  //will add to staging area, remember
            
but if you do $git status
NOW git realizes both are actually same files adn says "renamed" (but just after you modified using fs, you did "git status" it says not 
same)So, once it gets to the staging index, it actually compares the data between the two and says oh, these are pretty close. It doesn't 
have to be exactly the same, some changes could have taken place at the same time.I think the threshold is about 50%. As long as the data 
is about 50% the same between the two of them, it says oh, okay, this is the same file. 



method 2:
git mv aaa.txt bbb.txt
this renames as well as adds to the staging area
(feeling bad about why it has to do both? well, if you just want to rename, why not use only unix command "rm")

even if you want to move a file to antoher folder, it's teh same
in git; ----- moving ==== renaming
git mv aaa.txt anotherFolder/bbb.txt
