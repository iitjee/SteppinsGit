The first thing we need to know is that there's three places that Git stores configuration information and depends on how widely we want 
those configurations to apply. The first and largest is System level configuration, that is configurations that ought to apply to every 
user of this computer. Now each user, of course, can overwrite it with their own, but these are going to be default configurations. Now in 
truth you won't use this very often. It's much easier and much better to set it up on a per user basis, but I just want you to know that 
it exists.

..watc hthe course :/
