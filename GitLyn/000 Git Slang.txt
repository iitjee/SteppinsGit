"git status shows us that our working directory is clean, and our working directory is now the same state as our repository."
working directory is clean => nothing to commit
 working directory is now the same state as our repository => same as above... ntn to commit
 
 
 staging area = staging index = staging directory



if you "git log" fro the first time (even before any commmit)
you get "fatal: your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet"
nothing to worry
(previ. it used to say, "fatal : bad default revision 'HEAD')
Git log comes up and says oops, the HEAD doesn't point to anywhere useful yet, that's basically what it's telling us that HEAD isn't 
pointing anywhere useful, and it's trying to find the HEAD because remember the HEAD points to the last commit. Well, there hasn't been a 
commit yet, so HEAD hasn't been established, and that really just happens right when you first initialize your project. Once we make our 
first commit, then it will all be there.
