git diff
//changes b/w repository level and working directory level
(=> if you stage any file, those changes won't appear! to see them see below)




git diff --staged
(same as git status --cached       old name)
give chanages b/w repository level and working directory level



git diff myFile.txt
//to get changes only in one particular file



// to see looong lines nicely---- press minus key then, shift+s adn click return
It's showing me pages of results and in fact if I scroll this up like this, you can see that it's now asking me. Here, it's prompting me, 
waiting for me to hit the spacebar to show me the rest of the results, and I can use F and B to go forwards and backwards through those 
results. What this is the less pager that's built into UNIX. So I'm using the less pager to see these results.

The less pager has a 
feature where I can either start it up using the -R command, and you can set that in your global configuration or while I'm inside of it I 
can press the minus key and then Shift+S and then hit Return, and it will fold those long lines.
(this'll soft-wrap the lines acc to size of window instead of getting truncated! xD )

 And if I want to switch it back -S and Return chops the long lines instead. Now as I said that is something you can use a configuration 
 for in your config file if you wanted to always be that way
 
 
 
 
 
 //VERY COOL!!
 git diff --color-words contact.html
  it gives me that same information, but instead of having two separate lines it gave me a different format, and 
  it put the change here in the same LINE!!!!!! wow!!!
  side by side.
