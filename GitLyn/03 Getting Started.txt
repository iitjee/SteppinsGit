git init
ls //no files are seen
ls -la //.git FOLDER is seen (hidden)
ls -la .git //inside .git Folder


all the tracking related stuff is stored in .git folder
if you ever watn to remove git tracking, u just delete .git folder

.git
this is Git's workspace, you don't want to come in here and start messing around and changing things, leave it alone, let Git manage these 
files and let it put things where they need to be. The only exception to that would be the config file, that's the only thing that you 
would really ever come in here and either take a look at or even possibly edit.

git vs svn
Now again, I want to just emphasize the point that everything that Git does is going to be stored in this single top-level directory, 
 that's very different from svn. If you've worked with svn before, svn puts little tracking files in every single directory down the line.
So if you wanted to remove svn, you have to go through and actually pull out those .svn files from every single directory so that it will 
stop tracking those. Git doesn't do that, Git puts them all right here in one place at the top level.
