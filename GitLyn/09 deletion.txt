two ways:
1. remove the file manually and then 'git' it
2. use 'git' to both remove and commit


method 1:
when you delete manually, adv is you'll hav eit in trash
(ofc, since all previous file versions are stored in the repo, it doesn't matter much anyway)
      $git rm MyFileName //stages it (like add)
      $git commit -m "blabla"
      
method 2:
    $git rm myFileName
(both removes and adds to the staging area)
